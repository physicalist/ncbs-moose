	This directory contains code for python interface for
moose. There are C++ wrappers for relevant moose classes. These
classes are visible to python through a swig wrapper. The file moose.i
contains the swig interface definition. All moose classes that can be
used through python extend one base class - PyMooseBase.

	Some of the moose functionalities are available through this
base class. And the classes named after the moose classes act as a
very thin wrapper over the latter.

	The module is named 'moose'. To compile it, the make program
should be invoked as:

	make pymoose

	This creates moose.py, moose_wrap.cxx, _moose.so.
