This directory contains MOOSE documentation and demos for models that
run with MOOSE.

The Moose_users_guide.txt and G2M_users_guide.txt are somewhat preliminary.
The Moose_developers_guide.txt is much more complete, but still has far to go.

cd into the demo directory for instructions on how to run them.
