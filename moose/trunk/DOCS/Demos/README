This directory has a set of demos for MOOSE:
1. Kinetic simulation
2. Squid demo
3. Test for ConcChannels:
4. Test for Calcium channels and Nernst objects:
5. Traub 91 demo, CA3.
6. Traub 91 demo, CA1.
7. Mitral cell demo
8. Synaptic channel demo

All outputs are in xplot format, which is a 2-column time, value textfile 
with separators between sections. If you don't have xplot, just look at the
file to figure out the format.

1. Kinetic simulation
moose kholodenko.g
Output file: kh.plot
This uses regular kinetikit dump files and a helper file, kkit.g 
(You may have to hit return again to get it to complete. Parser issue).
Output should be in kh.plot, consisting of 4 cycles of oscillation of various
molecules, with the first cycle being longer.

.............................................................................

2. Squid demo
moose squid.g
Output is in squid.plot. Should have 3 cycles of action potentials, essentially
identical to those in the GENESIS squid demo.

3. Test for ConcChannels:
moose testConcChan.g
output file: kh.plot
This uses regular kinetikit dump files and a helper file, kkit.g 
Should produce a nice sine-wave between 0 and 2 at the input. The out conc
should be a small ripple around 1.6e-3. The in conc should be a near
sine-wave between 0.2e-3 and 1e-3

4. Test for Calcium channels and Nernst objects:
moose casquid.g
output file: casquid.plot
This is the squid demo enhanced. As a test we connect the Na channel current
into a CaConcen, and this into a Nernst.  The two of these are also plotted.
Output file is casquid.plot.  NaConc (the Na current in a CaConcen) rises
sharply on first AP and then goes in 3 cycles of oscillation between
0.4e-5 and 1e-5.
CaPotl starts up at a bit over 0.1 V and then goes between 0.05 and 0.06 V.
Vm behaves much the same as for the regular squid demo, with three action
potentials from -0.075 V to +0.025 V.

5. Traub 91 demo, CA3.
moose ca3.g
output file: ca3.plot
This uses CA3.p and traub91proto.g, in the original form from the traub91 demo.
(You may have to hit return again to get it to complete. Parser issue).
This is a test of many things: reading a complicated script file like
traub91proto.g, setting up channels, using readcell. 
Output is a burst with a large calcium buildup. The output is 
not perfectly aligned with that of the original traub91 demo in GENESIS, but
it is close. The differences are because of three factors, 
which will be addressed in due course: 
- the use of asymmetric compartments in MOOSE, rather than the symmetric ones
	in the traub91 demo, 
- the use of linear interpolation in MOOSE rather than B-splines for TABFILL,
	when filling up channel tables.
- the lack of an hsolver in MOOSE.

6. Traub 91 demo, CA1.
moose ca1.g
output file: ca1.plot
This uses CA1.p and traub91proto.g, in the original form from the traub91 demo.
(You may have to hit return again to get it to complete. Parser issue).
Similar to the CA3 demo. Output is a series of action potentials.
.............................................................................

7. Mitral cell demo
moose mit.g
outputfile: mit.plot
This uses the file mit.p to set up the model, and moosebulbchan.g to set up
the channels. moosebulbchan is slightly modified from bulbchan.g, and 
mit.p is unchanged.
As a comparison, you can run 
genesis genmit.g
to obtain the equivalent run using the GENESIS method. Output is genmit.plot.
Both the outputs from MOOSE and GENESIS are numerically inaccurate due to
the use of an explicit solution method with a longish timestep. MOOSE
is slightly better. The correct answer can
be seen if you set the hflag in genmit.g to 1. This will run it using the
hsolver, which gives a more accurate answer and also runs faster.
You can play with the simulation clock (line 66 in mit.g) to get a more 
accurate answer from MOOSE.

8. Synaptic channel demo
moose squidSyn.g
outputfile: squidSyn.plot
Tests: SynChan, SpikeGen
This is derived from the squid.g file to set up the basic model. This
version then adds a passive compartment called 'target' with a synapse
(a SynChan) on it. The squid axon is then connected to the synapse through
a SpikeGen. Delays and aboluteRefractoryPeriod are set so that of the
three action potentions, only the first and last cause a response in
the target.

Reference simulation:
cd squidSyn
genesis Squid
outputfile: squidSynGenesis.plot
This is the original squid demo plus the same passive compartment 'target'
connected with a synapse. The units are different but the outputs are
nearly identical to the MOOSE version.
