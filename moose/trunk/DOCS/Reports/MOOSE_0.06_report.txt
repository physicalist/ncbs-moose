Upi,

Sorry to be so late in getting to this, but I finally got a chance to try
compiling the Feb 17 0.06 MOOSE release.  The good news is that, with the
GCC4 flags, it compiles and runs on my laptop with Fedora FC4.  This has

Linux localhost.localdomain 2.6.11-1.1369_FC4 #1 Thu Jun 2 22:55:56 EDT 2005
  i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux
gcc (GCC) 4.0.0 20050519 (Red Hat 4.0.0-8)
flex version 2.5.4
bison (GNU Bison) 2.0

The bad news is that, for any set of flags, both my desktop (FC2) and dogstar
(RHEL on x86_64) give an error that sounds like the Debian one you
referred to.  I get:

cd genesis_parser
make[1]: Entering directory
`/chuck/dbeeman/plans/genfuture/New-grant/MOOSE/mus_release_feb17_2006/genesis_parser'
flex++ -oGenesisParser.yy.cpp GenesisParser.yy.l
bison -d GenesisParser.ypp
GenesisParser.ypp:928.17: syntax error, unexpected "|"
GenesisParser.ypp:932.17: syntax error, unexpected "|"
GenesisParser.ypp:936.17: syntax error, unexpected "|"
make[1]: *** [GenesisParser.tab.h] Error 1

Both these machines use
flex version 2.5.4
bison (GNU Bison) 1.875

the FC2 desktop is using
gcc (GCC) 3.3.3 20040412 (Red Hat Linux 3.3.3-7)

But, there is more good news - I just found the problem.  I grepped through
my notes on GENESIS 2.2 bugs and found:

script.y:932.3: parse error, unexpected "|"
script.y:1069.3: parse error, unexpected "|"

Here is  the summary of the fix:

There is some incorrect syntax in the yacc script genesis/src/ss/script.y
that didn't bother earlier versions of bison (e.g. 1.28), but causes
problems with bison 1.75 and later.  It arises because of some unwanted
semicolons on the lines before the "|".  Remove the three lines that are
tagged with a "-" below:

                 | '{' expr '}'
                   { $$ = $2; }
-               ;

                 | '{' cmd_stmnt '}'
                   { $$ = $2; }
-               ;

                 | '{' func_call '}'
                   { $$ = $2; }
-               ;

                 | '(' expr ')'
                   { $$ = $2; }

This appears to be exactly the problem in GenesisParser.ypp, and when I
removed the offending semicolons, it compiled without problems.
How old was the GENESIS 2 code that you used in the parser?  This was
fixed in GENESIS 2.2.1.

The DOCS/Demos are great!  Running these and playing on the command line
will be a good starting point for talking about priorities of what we need
to do next.

Running them on the laptop, I got a number of error messages on starting
moose and when giving commands to the moose> prompt.  I'm assuming these
are because I used the flags:
CFLAGS  =       -g -Wall -pedantic -DDO_UNIT_TESTS -Wno-invalid-offsetof

and this generates debugging information.  Typical ones are:

chuckito 105: ../../moose  mit.g
ValueFinfoBase::Error: Unable to initialize class Multi
...
Testing table: ................................... done
Error: PlainMultiConn::disconnectAll

or

OK
doing reset
Error: SingleMsgSrc::addRecvFunc: Error: rfunc mismatch with
existing func on /sched/cj/ct0
starting run for 0.1 sec.
OK

But, it nicely generated the file of plot data.  If you see anything
disturbing in these Error messages, let me know.

All in all, it looks like MOOSE has come a long way since last year.
