This is the 0.06 release of MOOSE
Date: 17 Feb 2006.

Overview: This is a minor upgrade to handle synapses. Implements the
synchan and spikegen objects. 
Internally this version sees a big shift to the use
of subversion for version control. Subversion has recently become supported
by SourceForge and it is a much nicer system than CVS. Once the subversion
management of MOOSE is stabilized here I will put the project on SourceForge.

Compilation instructions:
Edit Makefile to select GCC3 or GCC4 options. Some of the later GCC3 versions
actually seem to prefer the GCC4 flags.
Go into the mus_release_feb10_2006 directory and type
	make moose

Currently works on Fedora/Gcc4 and Gcc3. 
Known compilation issues remain with Debian due to issues with flex++.
Linux version 2.4.27-2-386 (gcc version 3.3.5 (Debian 1:3.3.5-13))
	As always, suggestions are welcome.

See DOCS/ReleaseNotes for details.
