This is the 0.02 release of MOOSE
Date: 20 Jan 2006.

Compilation instructions:

Go into the mus_release_jan20_2006 directory and type
	make moose

There are still loads of warnings, of two kinds:
	- "invalid access to non-static data member"
	- "warning: 'ret' is used uninitialized in this function"
	Ignore them.

Changes:
- Gcc4 Compiler fixes. 
- I have removed the #ifdef UNIX and #ifdef WINDOWS flags from the header.h
	These are now passed in by the compiler. The default is the
	behaviour for gcc4 and Windows. For GCC3 the compiler flag to use is
	-DNO_OFFSETOF
- Implementation of Table object, including loadtab function. This was the 
	major missing class for kinetic models.
- Object type name equivalence implemented for SLI backward compatibility.
	You can now do 'create kpool' in the SLI, and get a Molecule object.

Pending issues for next time:
- ConcChan class for kinetics 
- Ca_concen class for biophysics
- Nernst class for biophysics
- Compilation on Gentoo
- Compilation on Windows

==============================================================================
This is the 0.01 release of MOOSE.

It compiles on 32 and 64 bit versions of Linux, and with GCC 3 and 4.
To get it to work on GCC4 you need to change the flag from UNIX to WINDOWS
in the basecode/header.h file.

The basic simulation infrastructure is mostly working, with the
notable exception of solvers and parallelization.

Two models are illustrated: 

Kholodenko.g is a kinetikit dumpfile of
Boris Kholodenko's oscillatory MAPK model.

squid.g is an implementation of the Hodkgin-Huxley squid model.

Very few of the simulation classes are implemented, mostly those needed
to run these demos.

This release is made to let developers get started with MOOSE.

The next release is planned to support:

- More complete set of kinetic modeling classes
- Some more backward compatibility conversions for reading old GENESIS .g files.
- Windows compilation.
