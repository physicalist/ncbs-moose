This is the 0.03 release of MOOSE
Date: 27 Jan 2006.

Compilation instructions:

Go into the mus_release_jan27_2006 directory and type
	make moose

GCC4 no longer produces compiler warnings on my system, please provide
feedback about other systems.
Currently it fails compilation on Linux version 2.4.27-2-386 
	(gcc version 3.3.5 (Debian 1:3.3.5-13)) due to issues with flex.
	As always, suggestions are welcome.

Changes:
- Implemented ConcChan, CaConcen and Nernst classes. Test files:
	DOCS/Demos/testConcChan.g: Should produce a nice sine-wave between 
		0 and 2 at the input. The out conc should be a small ripple
		around 1.6e-3. The in conc should be a near sine-wave between
		0.2e-3 and 1e-3
	DOCS/Demos/casquid.g: The squid demo enhanced. As a test we connect the
		Na channel current into a CaConcen, and this into a Nernst.
		The two of these are also plotted. Output file is 
		casquid.plot.
		NaConc (the Na current in a CaConcen) rises sharply on
		first AP and then goes in
		3 cycles of oscillation between 0.4e-5 and 1e-5
		CaPotl goes between 0.05 and 0.06 mV.
- Sundry fixes to molecule backward compatibility to get input tables
	to work properly.
- Fix to ReadOnlyValueFinfo so that it correctly handles messaging requests
	for values, e.g. for plotting.
- Minor changes in compiler flags, and in various bits of code to get things
	to compile cleanly on GCC4.

Plans for next release:
- cellreader
- Compilation on Gentoo
- Compilation on Windows

==============================================================================
This is the 0.02 release of MOOSE
Date: 20 Jan 2006.

Compilation instructions:

Go into the mus_release_jan20_2006 directory and type
	make moose

There are still loads of warnings, of two kinds:
	- "invalid access to non-static data member"
	- "warning: 'ret' is used uninitialized in this function"
	Ignore them.

Changes:
- Gcc4 Compiler fixes. 
- I have removed the #ifdef UNIX and #ifdef WINDOWS flags from the header.h
	These are now passed in by the compiler. The default is the
	behaviour for gcc4 and Windows. For GCC3 the compiler flag to use is
	-DNO_OFFSETOF
- Implementation of Table object, including loadtab function. This was the 
	major missing class for kinetic models.
- Object type name equivalence implemented for SLI backward compatibility.
	You can now do 'create kpool' in the SLI, and get a Molecule object.

Pending issues for next time:
- ConcChan class for kinetics 
- Ca_concen class for biophysics
- Nernst class for biophysics
- Compilation on Gentoo
- Compilation on Windows

==============================================================================
This is the 0.01 release of MOOSE.

It compiles on 32 and 64 bit versions of Linux, and with GCC 3 and 4.
To get it to work on GCC4 you need to change the flag from UNIX to WINDOWS
in the basecode/header.h file.

The basic simulation infrastructure is mostly working, with the
notable exception of solvers and parallelization.

Two models are illustrated: 

Kholodenko.g is a kinetikit dumpfile of
Boris Kholodenko's oscillatory MAPK model.

squid.g is an implementation of the Hodkgin-Huxley squid model.

Very few of the simulation classes are implemented, mostly those needed
to run these demos.

This release is made to let developers get started with MOOSE.

The next release is planned to support:

- More complete set of kinetic modeling classes
- Some more backward compatibility conversions for reading old GENESIS .g files.
- Windows compilation.
