This directory contains MOOSE documentation and demos for a biochemical
reaction and for the squid model.

The Moose_users_guide.txt and G2M_users_guide.txt are somewhat preliminary.
The Moose_developers_guide.txt is much more complete, but still has far to go.

The Demos are run using 

	moose squid.g
and should emit a plot 
	squid.plot

The kinetic demo is run using

	moose kholodenko.g
and should emit a plot 
	kh.plot

You will need to hit return once when doing the kholodenko demo.
The kholodenko.g file is a regular kkit dump file. You can try other simple
models - they should work too.
As of Jan 2006 the parser is temperamental and needs a second hit of the
return key to complete loading the kholodenko model.
