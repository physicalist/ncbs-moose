This is the 0.01 release of MOOSE.

It compiles on 32 and 64 bit versions of Linux, and with GCC 3 and 4.
To get it to work on GCC4 you need to change the flag from UNIX to WINDOWS
in the basecode/header.h file.

The basic simulation infrastructure is mostly working, with the
notable exception of solvers and parallelization.

Two models are illustrated: 

Kholodenko.g is a kinetikit dumpfile of
Boris Kholodenko's oscillatory MAPK model.

squid.g is an implementation of the Hodkgin-Huxley squid model.

Very few of the simulation classes are implemented, mostly those needed
to run these demos.

This release is made to let developers get started with MOOSE.

The next release is planned to support:

- More complete set of kinetic modeling classes
- Some more backward compatibility conversions for reading old GENESIS .g files.
- Windows compilation.
