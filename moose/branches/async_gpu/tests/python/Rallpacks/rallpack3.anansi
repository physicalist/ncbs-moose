### Objective.

Tests the ability of Moose simulator to evaluate the Hodgkin-Huxley channel models.

### Details

This model consists of the cable from Rallpack1 with the addition of
squid sodium and potassium channels from Hodgkin and Huxley.

This simulation models a uniform unbranched cable with 1000 identical
compartments, with a length constant of 1, a diameter of 1 micron, and a total
length of 1 mm.

The membrane properties are :

    RA = 1.0 ohms meter		= 100 ohms cm
    RM = 4.0 ohms meter^2		= 40000 ohms cm^2
    CM = 0.01 Farads/meter^2	= 1.0 uf/cm^2
    Eleak = ERest = -0.065 V	= -65 mV

The channel properties are as described by Hodkin and Huxley, as follows :
(We have reversed their sign convention, and take the resting potential to
be -65 mV)

    ENa = 0.050 V			= 50 mV
    EK  = -0.077 V			= -77 mV
    GNa = 1200 Siemens/m^2		= 120 mmho/cm^2
    GK  = 360 Siemens/m^2		= 36 mmho/cm^2
    (For each compartment :
    Gbar_Na= 3.77e-9 Siemens	= 3.77e-6 mmho
    Gbar_K = 1.131e-9 Siemens	= 1.131e-6 mmho )

    gNa= Gbar_Na * m^3 * h
    gK = Gbar_K * n^4

    dm/dt = alpha_m*(1-m) - beta_m*m
    dh/dt = alpha_h*(1-h) - beta_h*h

    dn/dt = alpha_n*(1-n) - beta_n*n

    alpha_m = A (v-V0) / (exp((v-V0)/B) - 1)
    A = -0.1e6    1/(Volts*sec)	= -0.1	1/(mV*msec)
    B = -0.01     Volts		= -10	mV
    V0= -0.040    Volts		= -40	mV

    beta_m = A exp((v-V0)/B)
    A = 4.0e3     1/sec		= 4.0	1/msec
    B = -0.018    Volts		= -18	mV
    V0= -0.065    Volts		= -65	mV

    alpha_h = A exp((v-V0)/B)
    A = 70.0      1/sec		= 0.07	1/msec
    B = -0.020    Volts		= -20	mV
    V0= -0.065    Volts		= -65	mV

    beta_h = A / (exp((v-V0)/B) + 1)
    A = 1.0e3     1/sec		= 1.0	1/msec
    B = -0.010    Volts		= -10	mV
    V0= -0.035    Volts		= -35	mV


    alpha_n = A (v-V0) / (exp((v-V0)/B) - 1)
    A = -10.0e3   1/(Volts*sec)	= -0.01	1/(mV*msec)
    B = -0.01     Volts		= -10	mV
    V0= -0.055    Volts		= -55	mV

    beta_n = A exp((v-V0)/B)
    A = 125.0     1/sec		= 0.125	1/msec
    B = -0.080    Volts		= -80	mV
    V0= -0.065    Volts		= -65	mV

A current of 0.1 nA is injected in the first compartment. Membrane voltages
are recorded for the first and last compartments.

This model is run for a simulated time of 0.25 seconds.
