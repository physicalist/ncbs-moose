* Getting Started

** Linux

  Linux systems, if you have installed it from the package, it should already be in your path and have execute permission set. In that case just entering

  >moosegui 

  in the terminal, should fire up the GUI.   

  Linux for example 

  >python /usr/bin/moose/gui/moosegui.py (default location)

  >python /home/user/moose1.4/gui/moosegui.py

** Windows

  For Windows systems, find the Moosegui icon on your desktop or find software Moose via Start Menu, and then click moosegui.

  Windows for example (enter in command line)

  >python C:\\Program Files\MOOSE\gui\moosegui.py (32 bit)

  >python c:\\Program Files (x86)\MOOSEgui\moosegui.py (64 bit)

* MooseGUI layout

  #+ATTR_HTML: width = 60%
  #+ATTR_LaTeX: width=14cm
  [[/home/chaitu/moose1.4/DOCS/gui/documentation1.4/layout.png]]
  
  1. Menu
  2. Simulation Toolbar
  3. Visualization Area
  4. Plotting Area
  5. Moose Shell
  6. Property Editor
  7. Simulation Control Panel*
  8. Moose Element Tree*
  9. Moose Classes Panel*
  
  *by default not shown at startup, to make them visible: In [[MooseGUI layout][Menu]]>View> and check on corresponding item to show  

* Load Models

  In the menu area, click on [[MooseGUI layout][Menu]]>File>Load Model (or alternatively Ctrl+L)

  A dialog box as shown would show up. Nagivate to the model and open.

  Currenly only one model can be loaded in one session.

  #+ATTR_HTML: width = 60%

** Kinetikit Models

   In addition to regular GENESIS scripts, the GUI recognizes .g files that contain kinetikit models. Kinetikit models have the commands to plot variables of interest. When one load the model, all these plots are added to the available plot window in [[MooseGUI layout][Plotting Area]]. Moreover,  A graphical representation of the reaction network is displayed in the [[MooseGUI layout][Visualization Area]] and the plots in the [[MooseGUI layout][Plotting Area]]. 
   
   For example, load Kholodenko.g from DEMOS/kholodenko directory to get the following:

  #+ATTR_LaTeX: width = 14cm
  #+ATTR_HTML: width = 60%
  [[/home/chaitu/moose1.4/DOCS/gui/documentation1.4/kinetikit.png]]


   One can double click any item in the [[MooseGUI layout][Visualizaton Area]] and it  will be opened in the [[MooseGUI layout][Property Editor]] for the underlying MOOSE object. One can modify the properties of the objects (for example the initial concentration of a substrate) in the [[MooseGUI layout][Property Editor]]. (In the above example 'MKK-P' has been double clicked)

   
**  Neural Models 
    In the visualization area the cell is displayed. By default only if single celled models are visualized. (To change this see, [[New GL Windows][New GL Windows]])
    
    For example, load mitral.g from DEMOS/mitral-ee directory to get the following:  (currently .py and .g models are supported) 

  #+ATTR_LaTeX: width = 14cm
  #+ATTR_HTML: width =60%
  [[/home/chaitu/moose1.4/DOCS/gui/documentation1.4/clickedSoma.png]]
    
    + Interaction: 
      Click on a compartment to open the the compartment properties in the [[MooseGUI layout][Property Editor]]. Selected compartment is highlighted in green color. (In the above example 'soma' has been clicked. Notice the updation of the property editor fields)

    + Navigation:
      One can navigate in this area using mouse and keyboard. 
        + Click and drag to rotate model. 
        + Use arrow keys to pan the model. (try using x,z,y,u,a,q,<,>,PgUp,PgDown keys) 
        + Mouse wheel to zoom. 
    
    + New GL Windows:
      To add new GL Windows or to display models with more than one cell [[MooseGUI layout][Menu]]>View>New GL Window  A Dialog would then appear, here add the cells to be visualized. Also one can select the style in which, the visualization be displayed. The field you wish to visualize, while specifying the range of the values of the field and the choice of colormap.

* Record field values and Plots 
  
  To record field values of a particular moose object field, it must be added via the [[MooseGUI layout][Property Editor]]. 
  + The corresponding field of interest is to be dragged onto the plot window in [[MooseGUI layout][Plotting Area]] (OR)
  + Click the third column in the [[MooseGUI layout][Property Editor]], to bring up a combo box from which the plot window name ('Plot 0' as shown below) can be selected

  #+ATTR_LaTeX: width=14cm
  #+ATTR_HTML: width = 60%
  [[/home/chaitu/moose1.4/DOCS/gui/documentation1.4/plotCombo.png]]
 
  One can add new plot windows to the [[MooseGUI][Plotting Area]] (in [[MooseGUI layout][Menu]]>View>New Plot Window), by default 1 plot is shown (named Plot 0). 
  To close the plots, right click on the window pane of the corresponding plot window. 
  Change the layout of the plots by changing it from [[MooseGUI layout][Menu]]>View> Tabbed View / Cascading Plots

  To change the setting of the lines that are displayed on the current plot, click on the lines legend in the plot

  To overlay plots, select the plot window, and press Cntrl+H or check Menu>Edit>Overlay plot
  

* Run Simulation
  
  To run the simulation, use the [[MooseGUI layout][Simulation Toolbar]] Use the 'Run','Continue' and 'Reset' buttons here for the corresponding actions.
  
  Further, to change the time step interval of the simulation and the plot/visualization update interval use the simulation control (by default not visible, to make visible, check [[MooseGUI layout][Menu]]>View>Simulation Control)
  

* Save 

  To save plots use [[MooseGUI layout][Menu]]>File>Save Plots (Ctrl+S). Saving action prompts user for the directory in which one wishes to save the files, this dumps all the data on the plot windows into corresponding fieldname.plot files. (One can save plots only after running the simulation)


* Reset Settings

  To reset the layout of the GUI (also resets the 'First Time Wizard') use [[MooseGUI layout][Menu]]>File>Reset Settings, the settings are restored only after restarting moosegui.py


* Help

  Please see the status bar of the moosegui window, as you navigate through the windows. 

  Alternately, you can use the 'Whats this?' feature by clicking the question mark in the Simualtion Toolbar.
