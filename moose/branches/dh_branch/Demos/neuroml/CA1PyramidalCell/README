This is the directory for the NeuroML files generated by neuroConstruct 1.5.3 (neuroConstruct.org) for CA1 cell model.
These files were exported from neuroConstruct as Level 3 NeuroML v 1.x files (not a single NeuroML Level 3 file).

Fire up moose GUI. File->Load Model or Ctrl+L. Navigate to this directory.
Select the 'files of type' combo box to 'NeuroML/SBML' and open the CA1.net.xml file.
Select the soma (graphical viewer or element tree) and drag and drop Vm from the properties editor to the plot pane.
Run the simulation and see the soma Vm.

To test on the terminal, just run CA1.py (pops up soma Vm).
