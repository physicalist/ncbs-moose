Unit tests
----------------------------

For each ion channel `chan`, there is a hoc file called
`test_chan.hoc`. Running this file will create Channel_Vm.dat and
Channel_Gk.dat wehere `Channel` is the camelcased name of the channel
(used in MOOSE). 

For [Ca2+ ] object we have test_cad.hoc in nrn directory and
test_capool.py in py directory.

The channel names in MOOSE do not always match the NEURON names, but
the data files generated are consistent between the two
versions. Already the reference data is provided in gzipped form in
nrn/data directory. If you want to update this data by rerunning the
NEURON tests, run `gzip *.dat` to compress them as MOOSE tests expect
the reference data to be in this form (with extension .gz).

To run all the MOOSE tests, do: `python -m unittest -v test_nachans
test_kchans test_cachans test_archan test_capool` from the
commandline.

The standard test is apply 1 pA current injection from 50 to 150 ms,
then apply a -1 pA current injection from 200 to 300 ms.
