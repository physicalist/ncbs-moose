Installment 1 - The Basics

As an introduction to the general neural simulation system (GENESIS) and the
x-based online display utility for simulations (XODUS), we have put together
a demonstration simulation and tutorial (SQUID) which will help you learn
how to use these tools for constructing your own simulations and for
customizing your user interface.  In the process of working through this
tutorial, you will also learn something about the Hodgkin-Huxley model.
This program may serve as a good starting point for those of you who plan to
work on single-cell models for a course project.

The Model
=========
For the time being, we are going to simulate a single axon compartment with
active Na and K conductances, as described by Hodgkin and Huxley for the
squid giant axon.  In other tutorials we will link compartments together to
form a simple model of an entire neuron with a soma and dendrites (the
Neuron tutorial), model a cable with many compartments (the cable tutorial),
and build neural circuits with connected neurons (MultiCell and tritonia).
For now, we confine ourselves to a single axon compartment.
 
Running the Simulation
======================
The model has already been initialized with some reasonable parameter values,
so all you have to do to run the simulation is:

click on the ``RUN'' button in the ``Simulation Control'' panel 

The simulation which you just observed was for a constant current pulse,
which is shown in the lower left graph panel.  The upper left graph shows
the membrane potential.  You can see that 3 action potentials were generated
during this 50 msec simulation.  Now let's change the injection current and
see what happens. At the bottom of the screen is a control panel labeled
`Current Clamp Mode'' and below it is a panel with five dialog-buttons.
They have both the properties of a dialog box, which accepts input from the
keyboard, and a button that executes a command script when it is pressed. In
order to change the injection current:

position the cursor to the right of the last digit in the "Pulse 1 Current"
field and click in the dialog box with the left mouse button

You should see the little ``^'' symbol move to the new cursor location.
Let's change the peak injection current from 0.1 to 1.0.

type <DELETE> to backspace over the 0.1 and then type 1.0

The value in the dialog field should now be 1.0.  At this point we need to
activate the dialog button to send this new value to the simulator. There
are two ways to do this; you can either hit <RETURN> when the mouse is
within the dialog field or you can click on the button with the left
left-mouse button.  We will now try both techniques.  First, make sure the
cursor is somewhere in the "Pulse 1 Current" field (it will be a vertical
bar, not an X), and then

hit <RETURN> anywhere in the dialog field

If this successfully actived the button, you should see a message appear in
the GENESIS command window.  The message should say something like "Setting
/pulsegen level1 1".  

You also could have activated the dialog-button by clicking on the box at the
left.  Do this now:

click on the "Pulse 1 Current"  button at the left of the dialog area

again you should see a message appear in the command window.  Note that you
normally only have to do one of these two things to activate the button.
The important point, however, is to make sure that you always do at least
one of them, either hit <RETURN > or click on the button.  Otherwise the
simulator will not know about the changes you make to the dialog.

Now we'll run the simulation again.

click the "RESET"  button on the control form
click the "RUN" button on the control form

There should be a dramatic change in the time-course of the membrane
potential at this higher current injection level.  Experiment with the
injection level to see what happens to the axon at higher injection
currents.  Also try decreasing the injection level until an action potential
is no longer elicited by the stimulus.  What is the threshold for producing
an action potential in this compartment?

You may also experiment with trains of short pulses.  Set the "Pulse 1 Width"
dialog field to 1 msec and click on the "Single Pulse" toggle so that it
reads "Pulse Train".  Now vary "Onset Delay 1".  What is the minimum
interval between action potentials that you can achieve?

Voltage Clamping
================
You can also perform voltage clamp experiments in this simulation.

click on  the "Toggle Vclamp/Iclamp Mode"  button at the bottom of the 
control form.

You should notice several things changing on the screen.  All the
changes are being controlled by the script attached to the "Toggle"
button.  The integration time step has been reduced from 0.1 msec to
0.01 msec, and a new "Voltage Clamp " form has appeared in place of the
"Current Clamp" form.  Again, reasonable default values have been
selected , so all you have to do to run the voltage clamp simulation
is:

click the "RESET"  button on the control form
click the "RUN" button on the control form

Changing Extracellular Concentrations
=====================================
You can alter the extracellular concentrations of the ions through the
"External Concentration" form".  Any changes in concentration will cause
the reversal potentials to be recalculated.  To reset the values back to 
the initial ones, just click on the "Default Values" button.

Controlling Graphs
==================
The graph of the clamp current (lower left panel) has gone off scale.  In 
order to rescale the graph:

click on the "scale" button in the upper left corner of the graph

A form containing dialog buttons for the coordinate range should appear.
Adjust ymin and ymax to bring the graph into range.  Remember to activate the
dialog buttons by either hitting <RETURN> in the dialog field or by clicking
on the button after you've made your changes. The x-axes of all graphs are
automatically scaled to the time of the simulation.

click on the "DONE" button to hide the "Graph Scale" form

It is often convenient to leave the "Graph Scale" form visible if you are
going to be making alot of scale changes.  Just drag the form to a
convenient place on the screen and leave it there. 

The "Graph Scale" form also has an "overlay" dialog button.
When overlay = 1, any existing plots in the graph will be held and new
simulation results will be overlayed. Try this now.

Set overlay = 1 for the graph of membrane voltage and run the simulation at
several values of the clamp voltage (remember to RESET between runs). To
clear all the graphs, click on the "Clear Graphs" button. This will not
RESET the graphs; you must do that yourself.

State Plots
===========
One can learn a great deal by studying plots in which one of the
Hodgkin-Huxley channel activation parameters (the K activation "n", the Na
activation "m", or the Na inactivation "h") is plotted as a function of the
membrane potential, V.  (See, for example, Chapter 5 of "Methods in
Neuronal Modeling", by Koch and Segev.)

In order to view such a plot, click the left mouse button on the "toggle"
button labeled "State Plot Hidden".  The label will change to "State Plot
Visible", and a state plot graph will appear.  Clicking the button again
will hide the graph.  The default plot is to show the K channel "n"
parameter on the y-axis and the membrane potential on the x-axis.  The
dialog boxes at the bottom of the graph allow you to change these defaults.

Channel Blocking
================
In order to explore the effects of blocking one of the channels, you may
click on one of the toggle buttons for blocking and unblocking a channel.
When a channel is blocked, its conductance is set to zero.  Activation
parameters for a blocked channel are still calculated and may be plotted,
but are relatively meaningless because they will have no effect on the
membrane potential.

Printing Graphs
===============
You can get a printout of a graph by positioning your cursor withing the
graph area and typing <CTRL-p>.  (You should check with your system
administrator to be sure that your workstation has been set up to print
the postscript output produced by this command.)  An even better way to
capture a portion of the screen is to use a screen-grabbing utility like
"xv" or "xgrabscr" from your favorite X-windows archive site.

Units used in the simulation
============================

Units:  time            msec 
        length          um (microns)
        potential       mV 
        conductance     mS (mmho)
