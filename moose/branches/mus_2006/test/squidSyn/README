This demo is a modified version of the GENESIS standard release Squid
demo. The current demo is meant to test synaptic connections using the
synchan and spikegen objects. A new compartment called 'target' is set up
with a synaptic channel (synchan) on it. The original squid compartment
is connected synaptically to this through a spikegen. The voltage output
of the target and the conductance of the synaptic channel are plotted.
Output is saved in the file squidSynGenesis.plot.
