This is the async13 branch. It is based on the current (buildQ) branch and
is designed to test out asynchronous messaging in MOOSE. This will drop
all the multithreading and queueing code framework with a view to simplifying
and speeding up calculations. It is also meant to implement parallelization
from the ground up, using either MPI or Charm++ messaging.
It is meant to keep the old buildQ API as much as possible.

Compiled the reduced code base, got most of the unit tests to work. 
Checkin 4792.

Fixed a dangling 'else' statement in the main.cpp that was preventing the
unit tests from closing. Now it is OK. Checkin 4793.

Next: eliminate threading. 
	much eliminating later, it compiles but doesn't clear unit tests.

Stuck in Shell::doReinit in the Qinfo::buildOn/buildOff around line 686
Eliminated all buildOn/buildOff calls. Now it croaks much sooner in the
unit tests.

Further cleanup. Moved the process loop into Clock. Gets some way through
unit tests but fails in testShellAddMsg(), seems that between Clock::doReinit
and doStart the message info isn't going around.
