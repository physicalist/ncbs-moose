Description: Moose, Multiscale Object Oriented Simulation Environment
    MOOSE spans the range from single molecules to subcellular networks, from
    single cells to neuronal networks, and to still larger systems.  MOOSE uses
    Python for scripting compatibility with a large range of software and
    analysis tools. It recognizes model definition standards including SBML,
    NeuroML, and GENESIS model file formats
