Description: MOOSE is the Multiscale Object-Oriented Simulation Environment. It is the base and numerical core for large, detailed simulations including Computational Neuroscience and Systems Biology.
 MOOSE spans the range from single molecules to subcellular networks, from
 single cells to neuronal networks, and to still larger systems.  MOOSE uses
 Python for scripting compatibility with a large range of software and
 analysis tools. It recognizes model definition standards including SBML,
 NeuroML, and GENESIS model file formatsGallery
 .
 MOOSE is open source software, licensed under the LGPL (Lesser GNU Public
 License). It has absolutely no warranty.
 .
 The MOOSE team is also participating in development of MOOGLI: a library and
 standalone application for displaying time-course of activity of detailed 3-D
 network models using OpenGL and also using OpenSceneGraph
