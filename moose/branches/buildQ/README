MOOSE is the Multiscale Object-Oriented Simulation Environment. is the
core of a modern software platform for the simulation of neural
systems ranging from subcellular components and biochemical reactions
to complex models of single neurons, large networks, and systems-level
processes.

Sourceforge project page: https://sourceforge.net/projects/moose/


* Getting MOOSE 
==============================================================================

** Released versions of MOOSE are available in the sourceforge fiel area:

   https://sourceforge.net/projects/moose/files/moose/Moose%20Beta%201.4.0/

   Download and install the prepackaged version suitable for your
   platform. If no such package exists, you can build it from the sources
   (download the file ending with tar.gz or tar.bz2 or zip and unpack it,
   go through README and INSTALLATION).

** Development version:

   You can download the development sources using a subversion client:

   svn co http://moose.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/moose/moose/trunk moose

   or 

   svn co http://moose.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/moose/moose/branches/{branchname} moose


* Building MOOSE from sources
==============================================================================

** Linux:

*** Requirements:
   - g++
   - gnu make
   - Python development headers and libraries
   - GNU Scientific Library (GSL) development packages
   - pthreads library
   - libsbml (if you want SBML support).
   - numpy development libraries


     On Debian based distributions these can be obtained by the command:

     sudo apt-get install g++ make python-dev libgsl0-dev libpthread-stubs0-dev python-numpy

     These names are for Ubuntu 12.04, the exact package names may
     vary depending on your distribution.

     On Fedora based distributions, you can use:

     sudo yum install {package names}

     where {package names} is the list of Fedora packages
     corresponding to thos mentioned above.
  


*** Building:

    You may need to inform make of C++ include directories and library
    directories if your installed packages are at non-standard
    location. For example, if your have libsbml installed in
    /opt/libsbml and the header files are located in
    /opt/libsbml/include and lib files are located in
    /opt/libsbml/lib, you can set the environment variables CXXFLAGS
    and LDFLAGS to include these before calling make:

    export CXXFLAGS= -I/opt/libsbml/include
    export LDFLAGS= -L/opt/libsbml/lib

    Lookup the manuals for gcc and gnu make to understand CXXFLAGS and
    LDFLAGS.


**** Release build:
     cd moose
     make BUILD=release

**** Debug build:
     cd moose
     make BUILD=debug

**** Python 3K
     By default, MOOSE is built for Python 2. In case you want to
     build MOOSE for Python 3K, you need to pass the additional flag:

     PYTHON=3

     like:
     
     make BUILD=release PYTHON=3


*** Running:

    The build process will generate the file _moose.so in
    moose/python/moose directory. The Python scripts for moose are
    located in the same directory. To import moose from Python, you
    need to add the moose/python directory in your PYTHONPATH
    environment variable:

    export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/moose/python

    assuming you have the moose directory inside your home directory.
    If you want to have MOOSE available to all users, copy it to your
    Python dist-packages directory.

    sudo cp -r $home/moose/python /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/moose

    /usr/lib/python2.7/ is the default location for installed Python
    modules on Ubuntu with Python 2.7. Replace it with that for your
    version.

    Now you can import moose in a Python script or interpreter with the statement:

    import moose


**** GUI:
     To run the moose GUI, you need some additional packages:

     - Python bindings for Qt4 or higher
     - matplotlib
     - Python OpenGL
     - Python bindings for Qt's OpenGL module

     On Ubuntu 12.04 these can be installed with:

     sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib python-qt4 python-qt4-gl 

     The GUI code is located in moose/gui.

     Again, for systemwide use, you can copy this directory somewhere
     and create a link to the MooseGUI.py file in that directory and
     make it executable:

     sudo cp -r moose/gui /usr/lib/python/dist-packages/moosegui
     sudo ln -s /usr/lib/python/dist-packages/moosegui/MooseGUI.py /usr/bin/moosegui
     sudo chmod a+x /usr/bin/moosegui
