MOOSEGUI: Graphical interface for MOOSE.
#+AUTHOR: This document: Upi Bhalla. GUI: Harsha Rani, H. Chaitanya

* Introduction
  The Moose GUI lets you work on [[file:Kkit12Documentation.org][chemical]]
  and [[file:Nkit2Documentation.org][compartmental neuronal]] models
  using a common interface framework. This document describes this common
  framework. In MOOSE 2.0.0, the interface lets you read, run, edit, and
  write chemical kinetic models, and to read, edit and run neuronal models.

** Platform

** Layout of interface
   [[./images/MooseGuiImage.png]]

** The menu bar
	In Ubuntu 12.04, the menu bar appears only when the mouse is in the 
	top menu strip of the screen. In other distributions it should
	appear over the top of the interface. The menu bar contains the
	following entries: *File*, *Edit*, *View*, *Solver*, *Help*.
	+ File ::
		- *Load Model*:
		  This leads to a file finder dialog. The default location
		  should bring you to the /Demos/ directory of MOOSE. 
		  Here you can go into the /Genesis_files/ subdirectory,
		  which contains legacy Kinetikit  (.g) format models.
		  The /neuroml/ subdirectory leads to a number of example
		  neuronal and network models, each in their own subdirectory.
		  The other demos are mostly standalone demos.
		- *Save Model*:
		  This currently works only for chemical kinetic models, and
		  only works for the Kinetikit format.
		- *Merge Models*:
		  This allows one to load in a new chemical kinetic model on 
		  top of an already loaded model.
		- *Save plots*:
		  Dumps plot contents to disk in xplot (ascii) format.
		- *Shell model*:
		  Not yet operational
		- *Reset settings*:
		  Restores interface settings to default.
		- *Quit*:
		  Quits the interface.
	+ Edit ::
		- *Settings*: 
		  Provides for changing interface settings such as 
		  file locations.
	+ View ::
		This allows one to control display of various parts of the
		interface.
		- *Moose shell*:
		  Currently inactive.
		- *Property editor*:
		  Toggles visibility of the panels for viewing and editing
		  object parameters.
		  This is to the upper right of the interface in the
		  interface layout example figure above.
		- *Simulation control*:
		  Toggles visibility of the panels for controlling running
		  of the simulation, at the bottom right of the interface
		  layout.
		- *Plot config*:
		  Toggles visibility of panels for making plots. This is
		  in the middle right of the interface layout.
		- *Sub Windows*:
		  This sets up the model view and the plot view panels into
		  separate sub-windows of the screen. Useful when you want
	   	  to watch plots at the same time as the cell display,
		  or to select and edit different parts of the model 
		  while watching the simulation progress.
		- *Tabs*:
		  This sets up the model view and plot view panels into
		  tabs on the screen, as in the example interface figure above.
		  This is useful to dedicate a larger portion of screen area
		  to each display.
	+ Solver ::
	   The Solver options currently only select between methods for
	   kinetic models. Details are in the 
	   [[file:Kkit12Documentation.org][chemical kinetics documentation]].
	   Options are:
		- Runge Kutta
		  This is the default method for integration of ODE systems. It
		  uses the Gnu Scientific Library 5-th order explicit variable-
		  timestep Runge-Kutta-Fehlberb method.
		- Gillespie
		  This is an implementation of Gillespies Stochastic Systems
		  Algorithm, which computes reaction progress using a stochastic
	   	  method.
