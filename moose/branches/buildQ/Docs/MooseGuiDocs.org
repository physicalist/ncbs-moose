MOOSEGUI: Graphical interface for MOOSE.
#+AUTHOR: This document: Upi Bhalla. GUI: Harsha Rani, H. Chaitanya

* Introduction
  The Moose GUI lets you work on [[file:Kkit12Documentation.org][chemical]]
  and [[file:Nkit2Documentation.org][compartmental neuronal]] models
  using a common interface framework. This document describes this common
  framework. In MOOSE 2.0.0, the interface lets you read, run, edit, and
  write chemical kinetic models, and to read, edit and run neuronal models.

** Platform

** Layout of interface

   [[./images/MooseGuiImage.png]]

** The menu bar
	In Ubuntu 12.04, the menu bar appears only when the mouse is in the 
	top menu strip of the screen. In other distributions it should
	appear over the top of the interface. 

	[[./images/MooseGuiMenuImage.png]]

	The menu bar contains the
	following entries: *File*, *Edit*, *View*, *Solver*, *Help*.
	+ File ::
		- *Load Model*:
		  This leads to a file finder dialog. The default location
		  should bring you to the /Demos/ directory of MOOSE. 
		  Here you can go into the /Genesis_files/ subdirectory,
		  which contains legacy Kinetikit  (.g) format models.
		  The /neuroml/ subdirectory leads to a number of example
		  neuronal and network models, each in their own subdirectory.
		  The other demos are mostly standalone demos.
		- *Save Model*:
		  This currently works only for chemical kinetic models, and
		  only works for the Kinetikit format.
		- *Merge Models*:
		  This allows one to load in a new chemical kinetic model on 
		  top of an already loaded model.
		- *Save plots*:
		  Dumps plot contents to disk in xplot (ascii) format.
		- *Shell model*:
		  Not yet operational
		- *Reset settings*:
		  Restores interface settings to default.
		- *Quit*:
		  Quits the interface.
	+ Edit ::
		- *Settings*: 
		  Provides for changing interface settings such as 
		  file locations.
	+ View ::
		This allows one to control display of various parts of the
		interface.
		- *Moose shell*:
		  Currently inactive.
		- *Property editor*:
		  Toggles visibility of the panels for viewing and editing
		  object parameters.
		  This is to the upper right of the interface in the
		  interface layout example figure above.
		- *Simulation control*:
		  Toggles visibility of the panels for controlling running
		  of the simulation, at the bottom right of the interface
		  layout.
		- *Plot config*:
		  Toggles visibility of panels for making plots. This is
		  in the middle right of the interface layout.
		- *Sub Windows*:
		  This sets up the model view and the plot view panels into
		  separate sub-windows of the screen. Useful when you want
	   	  to watch plots at the same time as the cell display,
		  or to select and edit different parts of the model 
		  while watching the simulation progress.
		- *Tabs*:
		  This sets up the model view and plot view panels into
		  tabs on the screen, as in the example interface figure above.
		  This is useful to dedicate a larger portion of screen area
		  to each display.
	+ Solver ::
	   The Solver options currently only select between methods for
	   kinetic models. Details are in the 
	   [[file:Kkit12Documentation.org][chemical kinetics documentation]].
	   Options are:
		- Runge Kutta
		  This is the default method for integration of ODE systems. It
		  uses the Gnu Scientific Library 5-th order explicit variable-
		  timestep Runge-Kutta-Fehlberb method.
		- Gillespie
		  This is an implementation of Gillespies Stochastic Systems
		  Algorithm, which computes reaction progress using a stochastic
	   	  method.
	+ Help ::

		  interface framework.

** The Model window
	The Model window displays a view of the model structure. These views
	vary depending on the model type. For a neuronal or neuronal network
	model, the window displays a 3-D view of the cell(s) in the model,
	and furthermore it sets the color of each compartment based on some
	variable value, typically /Vm/, the membrane potential of the 
	compartment. Note the 3-D axis indicators in the bottom left.

   	[[./images/NkitModelWindow.png]]

	In this window, the individual compartments can be clicked to select,
	and when selected, the compartment parameters and variables are
	displayed in the /property editor/ described below.

	For a chemical kinetics network, the window displays a schematic
	of the chemical reaction system. There are distinct icons for 
	molecules, reactions and enzymes, and these are connected by arrows
	to set up the reaction scheme. Again, any icon can be clicked to select
	and its parameters and variables come up in the /property editor/.

	[[./images/KkitModelWindow.png]]

	+ zooming, rotating and panning
	+ Selecting and viewing objects in the window

** The plot window
	The plot window displays time-series plots of the simulation. Plots
	are color-coded to distinguish them. In the case of the *kkit*
	interface the plots take the same color as the molecule pool that
	they represent.

	[[./images/KkitPlotWindow.png]]

	+ Zoom/Pan
	+ File ops

** The side panel
	The side panel displays three controls: the *Property editor*, the
	*Plot configuration* and the *Run control*.

*** Property editor
	The property editor displays parameters and variables of the
	selected model component (object). 

	[[./images/PropertyEditor.png]]

	The object many be 
	a compartments of a neuronal model, 
	or pools, reactions, or enzymes in a signaling
	model. 
	+ *The top of the property editor*: displays the class and 
	path of the selected object. 
	+ *See children*: opens a subsidiary table to navigate to child
	objects in the filesystem-like object tree.
	+ *Select Parent*: Navigates back up to the parent object in the
	+ *Properties*: This table displays 
	field names in the first column, followed by field values
	in the second. If the field is editable one can click on the
	value in the second column and change it.

*** Plot configuration
	The Plot configuration panel lets one set up new plots based on
	selected objects and their fields.

	[[./images/PlotConfig.png]]

	+ *The top line*: has the name of the object whose field is to be
	plotted.
	+ *Plot Field*: Specifies field to be plotted.
	+ *Plot Window*: Specifies which of the existing plot windows to use 			for the new plot.
	+ *New Plot Tab*: This button creates a new plot window as a tab.
	+ *Add Field*: Creates the plot as specified by the other options.
	+ *Overlay Plots*: When not checked, plots are cleared every time
		the \Reset\ button is hit. When checked, this retains the
		plots from the previous run.

*** Simulation control
	The \Simulation control\ panel controls how the model is run.

	[[./images/SimulationControl.png]]

	+ *Run Time*: Determines duration for which simulation is to run.
	 	If simulation has already run, this runs for the specified
		additional period.
	+ *Reset*: Restores simulation to its initial state; reinitializes
		all variables to t=0.
	+ *Stop*: This button halts an ongoing simulation.
	+ *Current time*: This reports the current simulation time.
	+ *Advanced options*: This is available only after /Reset/. This
		sets:
		- _Plotdt_: Timestep to use for updating plots.
		- _Simdt_: Timestep to use for internal simulation clocks.
			Edit only if you know what you are doing.
			For kinetic models, most of the numerical methods use
			variable timestep calculations, so this should be set
			to the same value as the /Plotdt/ in most cases.
		- _Update Plotdt_: How frequently should the screen refresh.
