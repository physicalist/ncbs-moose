* Introduction
  Neuronal models in various formats can be loaded and simulated in
  the *MOOSE Graphical User Interface*. The GUI displays the neurons
  in 3D, and allows visual selection and editing of neuronal
  properties. Plotting and visualization of activity proceeds
  concurrently with the simulation. Support for creating and editing
  channels, morphology and networks is planned for the future.

* Neuronal models
   Neurons are modelled as equivalent electrical circuits. The
   morphology of a neuron can be broken into isopotential compartments
   connected by axial resistances Ra denoting the cytoplasmic
   resistance. In each compartment, the neuronal membrane is
   represented as a capacitance Cm with a shunt leak resistance
   Rm. Electrochemical gradient (due to ion pumps) across the leaky
   membrane causes a voltage drive Em, that hyperpolarizes the inside
   of the cell membrane compared to the outside.

   Each voltage dependent ion channel, present on the membrane, is
   modelled as a voltage dependent conductance Gk with gating kinetics,
   in series with an electrochemical voltage drive (battery) Ek,
   across the membrane capacitance Cm, as in the figure below.

   Neurons fire action potentials / spikes (sharp rise and fall of
   membrane potential Vm) due to voltage dependent channels. These
   result in opening of excitatory / inhibitory synaptic channels
   (conductances with batteries, similar to voltage gated channels) on
   other connected neurons in the network.

   MOOSE can handle large networks of detailed neurons, each with
   complicated channel dynamics. Further, MOOSE can integrate chemical
   signalling with electrical activity. Presently, creating and
   simulating these requires pyMOOSE scripting, but these will be
   incorporated into the GUI in the future.

   To understand channel kinetics and neuronal action potentials, run
   the Squid Axon demo installed along with MOOSEGUI and consult its
   help/tutorial.

   Read more about compartmental modelling in the first few chapters
   of the [[http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/iBoG/iBoGpdf/index.html][Book of Genesis]].

   Models can be defined in [[http://www.neuroml.org][NeuroML]], an XML format which is mostly
   supported across simulators. Channels, neuronal morphology
   (compartments), and networks can be specified using various levels
   of NeuroML, namely ChannelML, MorphML and NetworkML. Importing of
   cell models in the [[http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS][GENESIS]] .p format is supported for backwards
   compatibitility.

* Neuronal simulations in MOOSEGUI

** Quick start
   + On first run, the MOOSEGUI creates moose/Demos directory in
     user's home folder. A few neuronal models are provided in
     directories inside moose/Demos/neuroml. For example, /File->Load/
     ~/moose/Demos/neuroml/CA1PyramidalCell/CA1.net.xml, which is a
     model of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell
     [[http://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/ShowModel.asp?model=55035][Migliore
     et al, 2005]] (exported using
     [[http://www.neuroconstruct.org][neuroConstruct]]). A 3D
     rendering of the neuron appears in *GL Window* tab.
   + Use click and drag to rotate, scroll wheel to zoom, and arrow
     keys to pan the 3D rendering.
   + Click to select a compartment on the 3D model, say the fattest
     cylinder near the center which is the soma / cell body. You may
     need to zoom/pan a bit.
   + Its *Properties* (which you can modify) will appear on the right pane.
   + Further, in *Plot configuration* in the right pane, *Plot field*
     Vm will be selected by default. Click *New plot tab* to create a
     blank plot and *Add field* to assign Vm of this compartment to
     the plot.
   + Run the model using *Run* button. By default, the model contains
     a current injection in the soma, which causes action potentials
     that decay into the dendrites.
   + You can switch between plot tabs and colour-coded 3D
     vizualization of spiking in the *GL Window* tab.
   + Manipulate and save plots using the icons at the bottom of the
     *Plot Window*.

User interface help is available at /Help->User Interface/. Here we delve into
neuronal simulations.

** Modelling details
   MOOSEGUI uses SI units throughout.

   Some salient properties of neuronal building blocks in MOOSE are
   described below. Variables that are updated at every simulation time
   step are are listed *dynamical*. Rest are parameters.
   + *Compartment* :: When you select a compartment, you can view and
                    edit its properties in the right pane. *Vm* and
                    *Im* are plot-able.
      - Vm :: *dynamical* membrane potential (across Cm) in Volts.
      - Cm :: membrane capacitance in Farads.
      - Em :: membrane leak potential in Volts due to the
              electrochemical gradient setup by ion pumps.
      - Im :: *dynamical* current in Amperes across the membrane via leak
              resistance Rm.
      - inject :: current in Amperes injected externally into the compartment.
      - initVm :: initial Vm in Volts.
      - Rm :: membrane leak resistance in Ohms due to leaky channels.
      - diameter :: diameter of the compartment in metres.
      - length :: length of the compartment in metres.

   After selecting a compartment, you can click *See children* on the right
   pane to list its membrane channels, Ca pool, etc.

   + *HHChannel* :: Hodgkin-Huxley channel with voltage dependent
                  dynamical gates.
      - Gbar :: peak channel conductance in Siemens.
      - Ek :: reversal potential of the channel, due to
              electrochemical gradient of the ion(s) it allows.
      - Gk :: *dynamical* conductance of the channel in Siemens. Gk(t)
              = Gbar \times X(t)^{Xpower} \times Y(t)^{Ypower} \times
              Z(t)^{Zpower}.
      - Ik :: *dynamical* current through the channel into the neuron in
              Amperes. Ik(t) = Gk(t) \times (Ek-Vm(t))
      - X,Y,Z :: *dynamical* gating variables (range 0 to 1) that may
                 turn on or off as voltage increases with different
                 time constants. dX(t)/dt = X_{inf}/\tau - X(t)/\tau.
                 Here, X_{inf} and \tau are typically
                 sigmoidal/linear/linear-sigmoidal functions of
                 membrane potential Vm, which are described in a
                 ChannelML file and presently not editable from
                 MOOSEGUI. Thus, a gate may open (X_{inf}(Vm)
                 \rightarrow 1) or close (X_{inf}(Vm) \rightarrow 0)
                 on increasing Vm, with time constant \tau(Vm).
      - Xpower,Ypower,Zpower :: powers to which gates are raised in
           the Gk(t) formula above.
   + *HHChannel2D* :: The Hodgkin-Huxley channel2D can have the usual
                  voltage dependent dynamical gates, and also gates
                  that dependent on voltage and an ionic
                  concentration, as for say Ca-dependent K
                  conductance. It has the properties of HHChannel
                  above, and a few more like Xindex as in the
                  [[http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/Hyperdoc/Manual-26.html#ss26.61][GENESIS
                  tab2Dchannel reference]].


   + *CaConc* :: This is a pool of Ca ions in each compartment, in a
                 shell volume under the cell membrane. The dynamical
                 Ca concentration increases when Ca channels open, and
                 decays back to resting with a specified time constant
                 \tau. Its concentration controls Ca-dependent K
                 channels, etc.
       - Ca :: *dynamical* Ca concentration in the pool in mMolar=mol/m^3.
               d[Ca^{2+}]/dt = B \times I_{Ca} - [Ca^{2+}]/\tau
       - CaBasal/Ca\_base :: Base Ca concentration to which the Ca decays
       - tau :: time constant with which the Ca concentration decays
                to the base Ca level.
       - B :: constant in the [Ca^{2+}] equation above.
       - thick :: thickness of the Ca shell within the cell membrane
                  which is used to calculate B (see Chapter 19 of
                  [[http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/iBoG/iBoGpdf/index.html][Book of GENESIS]].)

** Demos:
   - Cerebellar granule cell :: /File->Load/ 
        ~/moose/Demos/neuroml/GranuleCell/GranuleCell.net.xml . This
        is a single compartment Cerebellar granule cell with a variety
        of channels [[Maex, R. and De Schutter, E.,
        1997][http://www.tnb.ua.ac.be/models/network.shtml]] (exported
        from [[neuroConstruct][http://www.neuroconstruct.org]]). Click
        on its soma, and *See children* for its list of channels. Vary
        the Gbar of these channels to obtain regular firing, adapting
        and bursty behaviour (may need to increase tau of the Ca
        pool).
   - Purkinje cell :: /File->Load/ 
                      ~/moose/Demos/neuroml/PurkinjeCell/Purkinje.net.xml
                      . This is a purely passive cell, but with
                      extensive morphology [De Schutter, E. and Bower,
                      J. M., 1994] (exported from
                      [[neuroConstruct][http://www.neuroconstruct.org]]). The
                      channel specifications are in an obsolete ChannelML
                      format which MOOSE does not support.
   - Olfactory bulb subnetwork :: /File->Load/ 
        ~/moose/Demos/neuroml/OlfactoryBulb/numgloms2\_seed100.0\_decimated.xml
        . This is a pruned and decimated version of a detailed network
        model of the Olfactory bulb [Gilra A. and Bhalla U., in
        preparation] without channels and synaptic connections. We
        hope to post the ChannelML specifications of the channels and
        synapses soon.
   - All channels cell :: /File->Load/ 
        ~/moose/Demos/neuroml/allChannelsCell/allChannelsCell.net.xml
        . This is the Cerebellar granule cell as above, but with loads
        of channels from various cell types (exported from
        [[neuroConstruct][http://www.neuroconstruct.org]]). Play
        around with the channel properties to see what they do. You
        can also edit the ChannelML files in
        ~/moose/Demos/neuroml/allChannelsCell/cells_channels/ to
        experiment further.
    - NeuroML python scripts :: In directory
         ~/moose/Demos/neuroml/GranuleCell, you can run 'python
         FvsI_Granule98.py' which plots firing rate vs injected
         current for the granule cell. Consult this python script to
         see how to read in a NeuroML model and to set up
         simulations. There are ample snippets in
         ~/moose/Demos/snippets too.
