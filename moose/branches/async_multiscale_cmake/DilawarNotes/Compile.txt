- Added cmake based build system.
- Added a macro STRICK_CHECK. This macro raise exception instead of printing
  warning onto console.

- Added a ticket on sfn. The paths should be like /a[1]/b[2]/c[0] etc.  but they
  are /a[1]/b[2]/c[1]. I am not sure if this is wrong but in parser/Network.py
  file, I try to connect using /c[1] format rather than /c format. Let's wait
  for clarification.

- Using cython to create python bindings would take a lot of time and lot of
  effort. Not worth it. Left the code in repo as an excercise. This does some
  small bindings. I am done with cymoose for now.
