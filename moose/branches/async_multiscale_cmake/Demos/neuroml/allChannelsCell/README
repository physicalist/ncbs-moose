ABOUT 
-----

This is the directory for the NeuroML files generated by neuroConstruct 1.5.1
(neuroConstruct.org) for the Cerebellar Granule cell model [1].

These files were exported from neuroConstruct as Level 3 NeuroML v 1.x files
(not a single NeuroML Level 3 file).  However, further NeuroML channels have
been added to the single compartment, so that their effect can be studied.

RUNNING IN GUI
--------------

Fire up moose GUI. `File->Load Model` or `Ctrl+L`. Navigate to this directory.
Select and open the `allChannelsCell.net.xml` file.  Select the soma (graphical
viewer or element tree) and click 'add field' on the right 'plot configuration'
pane to plot Vm.  Run the simulation and see the soma Vm.

Select channels from the element tree and change Gmax to observe different
behaviours. Setting Gmax to zero is equivalent to removing the channel.

RUNNING IN TERMINAL
-------------------

The script `allChannelsCell.py` can be run by following command,
    
    python allChannelsCell.py 

By default, the results of simulation will be stored in figures, if you want to
display those figure in matplotlib figure window, then make second argument to
the function `loadGran98NeuroML_L123` `False`
