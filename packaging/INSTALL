1. On Ubuntu (12.04 and other LTS)

Following releases are supported: Vivid, Utopic, Trusty, Precise.

Open your terminal, set up the proxy variables (if any), and type the following
commands:

    $ sudo -E add-apt-repository ppa:dilawar/moose
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install moose-gui moose-moogli

In terminal, command `moosegui` will launch the GUI. From python interpretor, 
`import moose` will load the moose into python. 

2. RPM based distribution

For RPM, we are using Open-Build-Service to build MOOSE. This is experimental
build. Except Fedora, we could not build `moose-moogli`. 

Follow instructions on this page
http://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Amoose&package=moose-all
. And follow the instructions. Make sure that you have proxy variables
setup in your package manager.
