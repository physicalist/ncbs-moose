# Installing moose

We strongly recommend to use MOOSE repositories for installing it. Currently we
are building packages for Ubuntu, Fedora and OpenSuse. Generic DEB and RPM
packages are also built and can be downloaded from moose website. These generic
packages are only recommended if you can not use the repositories.

## Installing on Ubuntu

MOOSE-3.0.0 is being built on launchpad. Open the terminal and copy-paste
following lines (or type them one by one).

    $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:dilawar/moose
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install moose-python moose-gui

_NOTE_: First command adds MOOSE repository to your package-manager repository
list, second line update the database and third line installs the packages. Once
installation is complete: you can `import moose` in python and can launch gui by
typing `moosegui` in terminal.


## Installing on Fedora, Opensuse

For RPM, we are building MOOSE on Open Build Service. Click on the following
link, click on your distribution and follow the steps mentioned. 

http://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Adilawar&package=moose

## Downloading RPM and DEB packages

If your distribution is not supported above, then you can try to download the
generic packages for your architecture from the following link:

    http://moose.ncbs.res.in/content/view/35/70/

## Building from source code

If you feeling adventures then you can also build moose from its source code. We
recommend using CMAKE based build system. Download the source code using
subversion

    $ svn co https://svn.code.sf.net/p/moose/code/moose/tags/kheer_kadam_3.0.0/ moose
    $ cd  moose
    $ mkdir build 
    $ cd build
    $ cmake .. && make
    $ sudo make install

Please take care of dependencies before building MOOSE. Dependencies are listed
on README file.
