Description: MOOSE is the Multiscale Object-Oriented Simulation Environment. 
 It is the base and numerical core for large, detailed simulations including 
 Computational Neuroscience and Systems Biology. 
 . 
 MOOSE spans the range from single molecules to subcellular networks, from 
 single cells to neuronal networks, and to still larger systems. It is 
 backwards-compatible with GENESIS, and forward compatible with Python 
 and XML-based model definition standards like SBML and MorphML. It supports
 transparent parallelization, that is, it can run models on a cluster with no
 user effort required to parallelize them.
