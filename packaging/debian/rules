	## putting copying of moose files in wildcard target. This copies twice for build and binary targets.
	## If I put a separate binary: target, then this target's code i.e. dh $@ is not excuted.
	## Ideally, I should have some check here, do only if 'binary' target, but copying twice isn't too slow.
	## No longer copying files here, make install via dh_auto_install does the files copying.
