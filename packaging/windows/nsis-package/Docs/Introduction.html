		<H2>Excerpt from Release Notes</H2>
		These are the release notes for the Beta 1.2.0 release of MOOSE, the
		Multiscale Object-Oriented Simulation environment.
		<br><br>
		<strong>Introduction.</strong><br>
		This release has four major functional changes from the previous Beta 1.1.0:
		- A PyQt-based graphical interface for running basic simulations and tutorials.
			This is now the default 'face' of MOOSE.
		- Gillespie solver for chemical kinetic simulations.
		- SBML support for writing kinetic models, partial support for reading.
		- MPI support for parallel neuronal simulations, and interface to MUSIC.
		
		The default release now is PyMOOSE. For users who need to run non-graphical
		and batch-mode simulations, there is a separate GUI-free MOOSE release.
		The two are compatible. You can use PyMOOSE on a master node and have it
		talk to GUI-free MOOSE instances on the slave nodes of a cluster.

		<H2>Getting started</H2>
		Navigate to the <a href=../Demos/>DEMOS directory</a>, and the
		<a href=../Docs/>Documentation directory</a> to get started.
		Take a look at the <a href=../Demos/README.txt>Readme for demos</a>
		provided with the example scripts.
		<br><br>
		Don't worry, you can find these links again in the Start Menu's
		MOOSE directory.
		<br><br>
		Here is a <a href=README.txt>Readme file</a> giving a general
		introduction about MOOSE.
		<br><br>
		MOOSE emits various diagnostics when it croaks. Often these will help us
		debug it, if you can send them back to the
		<a href=http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=165660&atid=836272>bug tracker</a>
		on the MOOSE SourceForge.net site.
		<br><br>
		<H2>For Programmers</H2>
		You can find Doxygen generated documentation for the MOOSE API <a href=Doxygen.html>here</a>.
