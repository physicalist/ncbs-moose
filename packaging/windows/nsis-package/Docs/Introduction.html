		<H2>Excerpt from Release Notes</H2>
		These are the release notes for the Beta 1.1.0 release of MOOSE, the
		Multiscale Object-Oriented Simulation environment.
		<br><br>
		<strong>Introduction.</strong><br>
		This release has three major functional changes from the previous Beta 1.0.0:<br>
		- The development of PyMOOSE as a full-fledged user environment.<br>
		- The implementation of a much more functional single-neuron modeling engine<br>
		- The implementation of array objects and messages.<br>
		<br><br>
		The release also has a major overhaul to the release management, which has been
		coordinated by a new member of the MOOSE team, Ms. Siji George. The current
		release has binaries for Linux, Solaris, Mac and Windows. The Linux release
		includes a .deb package for simplifying the installation. There are several
		permutations for Python support and for 32/64 bits.
		We expect that the source compilation should also go more smoothly for those
		who wish to compile it themselves.

		<H2>Getting started</H2>
		Links to example scripts, and to documentation are placed in the
		Start Menu's MOOSE directory. Take a look at the Readme provided
		with the example scripts.
		<br><br>
		Here is a <a href=README.txt>Readme file</a> giving a general
		introduction about MOOSE.
		<br><br>
		MOOSE emits various diagnostics when it croaks. Often these will help us
		debug it, if you can send them back to the
		<a href=http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=165660&atid=836272>bug tracker</a>
		on the MOOSE SourceForge.net site.
		<br><br>
		<H2>For Programmers</H2>
		You can find Doxygen generated documentation for the MOOSE API <a href=Doxygen.html>here</a>.
