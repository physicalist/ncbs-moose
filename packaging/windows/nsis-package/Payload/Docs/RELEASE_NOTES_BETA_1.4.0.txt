This is MOOSE beta 1.4.0. At this point MOOSE has been used in several large
network and multiscale research simulations and this beta release is primarily
one for refinement of the current code framework. This beta release sees
many GUI developments including:
Run-time visualization and interaction GUI for cell models in 3D
Run-time visualization and interaction GUI for signaling models
Improved layout of the GUI, with a convenient Simulation Control Toolbar.
This beta release also has simulator core object developments including:
Efield object used in simulating field and EEG electrodes, ported from GENESIS
PulseGen enhanced with arbitrary numbers of levels, delays, and width.
Classes added to support stochastic synapses with short-term plasticity.
Hsolve updates for better single-neuron and network modeling.

Major contributors to this beta release are
GUI work: Chaitanya, Harsha Rani
Code base: Subhasis Ray, Niraj Dudani
Release management: Siji George.

This is likely to be the final beta release, and following this MOOSE will
switch over to a new code base which supports multithreading and MPI.
Thus the next development cycle will be a release-candidate whose main
focus will be to replicate the current features on the new code base.
