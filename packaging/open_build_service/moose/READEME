This document describes how to use OSC from command line to build the package.

    1. To commit changes, use 
            osc ci
        This will trigger _service to run on server. Once _service is run, a
        tar file will be created by fetching the source code from the server.
        Once this is done, we need to trigger build.

    2. Trigger building on OSC.
            osc
