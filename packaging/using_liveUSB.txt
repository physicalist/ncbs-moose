Instructions to boot into the MOOSE 2.0.0 - Ubuntu 12.04 32-bit live USB:

0) Power down laptop/computer.

1) Insert USB into usb 2.0 port on laptop/computer.
Avoid usb 3.0 ports as loading becomes very slow possibly due to incompatibility with these usb 2.0 pen drives.
(USB 3.0 ports have blue innards - blue connector inside the laptop port).

2) Power-up computer and ...
A) Most new laptops and computers have a key to be pressed just after powerup to select boot device.
***********
PC: Usually the key is F9 on HP, F10 on Sony, F12 on Lenovo, Dell and Acer, and ESC on ASUS. Sometimes F8 also works.
MAC: Press C on intel-based macs on startup for booting from USB/CD.
***********
Press requisite key and select USB Transcend as the boot device.
The requisite key is written as last line on display on starting laptop - press within 1-2 seconds of it being displayed,
else it'll go ahead with normal boot and you need to reboot and start again.

OR

B) You need to go into BIOS setup, usually pressing 'del' or 'F2' key, and set boot order to usb first.

3) After a while, it'll ask to 'Try Ubuntu' or 'Install Ubuntu'. Choose 'Try Ubuntu' to run it as a live USB.

4) When it asks for password, type 'moose'.
username: moose
password: moose

5) On logging in, MOOSE GUI and MOOSE Squid Axon demo are available on the Desktop as icons and on the sidebar.
Double-click Desktop icon or single-click sidebar icon to run any of them.

6) About 10-15 seconds after logging in, a crash report window will open:
'the app Ubuntu Software Center has closed unexpectedly.'
Click on 'Leave Closed'. Click 'cancel' when apport tries to collect and send info about the problem.
[This is not due to MOOSE, somehow the Ubuntu Software Center is starting up on its own.
Maybe it's just on my laptop or could be generic. But no time to probe why this is happening.]
